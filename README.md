## About The Project

This is a project that gets articles information from a website and sends the url to an OpenAI chatbot to generate a summary of the article in the lenght of a tweet. It also gets the image/video of the article and tweets it using the Twitter API. 

It is expected to be self automated and to post every new article is posted from different news websites. Then, when it gets lots of followers, it will be able to generate some revenue from ads.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

You need to have an .env file with the Twitter API tokens and secrets, and the OpenAI API key. You can get the Twitter API tokens and secrets from the Twitter Developer Portal. You can get the OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.

In this project I have considered that the news websites can be given via a Google Sheets file, in that case you will need a Google Cloud Platform account and a Google Sheets API key. You can get the Google Sheets API key from the Google Cloud Platform website. But this is not mandatory, it can be given from a JSON file inside the project.

That should be it. Just cron the script and check the magic.
